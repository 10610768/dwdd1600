                            To create a 3D printed object, you use an “additive process”. The three-dimensional object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is finished.

                        <dd>
                        3D printing materials can vary widely, with options that    include plastic, powders, resins, metal and carbon fiber. Out of all the raw materials for 3D printing in use today, plastic is the most common.

                            3D printing has developed significantly and can now   perform crucial roles in many applications, with the most common applications being manufacturing, medicine, architecture, custom art and design, and can vary from fully functional to purely aesthetic applications.

            <p>3D printing, also known as <em>additive manufacturing</em>, uses   specialized equipment to create solid, three-dimensional objects from a digital file. The practice has been around since the 1980s, when <a href="https://www.invent.org/inductees/charles-hull" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles W. Hull</a> invented the process and created the first 3D-printed part. Since then, the field of 3D printing has grown exponentially and holds countless possibilities.

            <p>3D printers can fill a role in virtually almost every industry. Companies all over the world now employ 3D printers to create their prototypes in a matter of hours, instead of wasting months of time and potentially millions of dollars in research and development. Schools all over the world are are also using 3D printers to bring hands-on learning to the classroom

            <h2>Is 3D Printing Expensive?</h2>
                <p>At the entry level, 3D printing is remarkably affordable.     Desktop 3D printers are available for as little as $200 to     $500. These printers are straightforward to use and maintain, making them ideal for beginners and hobbyists. The materials for these printers, such as PLA and ABS filaments, are also inexpensive, typically costing between $20 and $50 per kilogram. This affordability extends to the software required for designing 3D models, with many free or low-cost options available, such as <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tinkercad</a> and <a href=" https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank"        rel="noopener">Blender</a>.
